#Frontend

Create a simple react app.
That at the start gets the dummy data from this URL: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts

This should get you 100 posts.

Once you receive the posts, use pagination and by default display only 10 posts per page. Give an option for the user to select between 5, 10, or 15 posts per page.
Display the id, title, and body of the post.

Style into a pleasant responsive look (you are free to use the ‘card’ look for each post or whatever design you think fits best. You are free to display only part of the body text if the text is too long).


Note that:

For styling, you can use Sass, styled components, or normal CSS, but no other styling libraries.

You are NOT allowed to use AXIOS or other similar libraries for making HTTP requests to fetch the data.
